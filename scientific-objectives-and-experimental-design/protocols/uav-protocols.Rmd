## Abstract

## Materials

### Platforms

* SenseFly eBee fixed-wing drone
* Hexacopter

### Cameras

UAV data are collected using one of three cameras:

* 5-band [MicaSense RedEdge](https://www.micasense.com/rededge)
* 4-band + RGB [Parrot Sequoia](https://www.micasense.com/sequoia)
* SenseFly thermal [thermoMap](https://www.sensefly.com/drones/accessories.html)

Cameras are carried singly or in tandem on the SenseFly eBee fixed-wing drone \(Sequoia and thermoMap, individually only\), or a hexacopter \(RedEdge or Sequoia, individually or in tandem\).

## Procedure

### Flight

Standard flight altitude is 44m with 75% image overlap \(both sequentially and laterally\), and missions are programmed and managed by either [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/index.html#) or senseFly [eMotion](https://www.sensefly.com/software/emotion-2.html).

### Calibration

No radiometric calibration was conducted as of Nov 5, 2016.

### Analysis

Pix4D software was used to generate gray-scale orthomosaic geotiff files containing NDVI data after georegistration to the WGS84/UTM 12 N coordinate reference system using three to five 2D geo-located ground control points. These are manually matched to 5-40 images each. Ground control points for the Lemnatec Field Scanner are on the concrete pylons and were geolocated using an RTK base station maintained by the USDA-ARS at Maricopa \(see section on [geospatial information](../../user-manual/data-products/geospatial-information.md)\).

QGIS software was used to confirm geospatial alignment of NDVI geotiffs with shape files containing geolocated positions of the rail foundations. A shape file containing polygons aligning with the middle two rows of each of the 350 experimental units \(for sorghum crop Aug-Nov 2016\) was kindly generated by Dr. A French of USDA-ARS. Zonal Statistics in QGIS was used to calculate NDVI means for each plot polygon.
