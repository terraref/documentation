## Abstract

Automated VIS and NIR imaging in a controlled growth environment

## Materials

ProMix BRK20 + 14-14-14 Osmocote pots; pre-filled by Hummert Sorghum seed

## Equipment

* Conviron Growth House
* LemnaTec moving field conveyor belt system 
* Scanalyzer 3D platform

## Procedures

**Planting**

* Plant directly into phenotyping pots 

**Chamber Conditions**

Pre-growth \(11 days\) and Phenotying \(11 days\)

* 14 hour photoperiod
* 32oC day/22oC night temperature
* 60% relative humidity
* 700 umol/m2/s light

**Watering Conditions**

* Prior to phenotyping, plants watered daily
* The first night after loading, plants watered 1× by treatment group to 100% field capacity \(fc\)
* Days 2 – 12, plants watered 2× daily by treatment group \(100% or 30% FC\) to target weight

**Automation**

* Left shift lane rotation within each GH, during overnight watering jobs
* VIS \(TV and 2 x SV\), NIR \(TV and 2 x SV\) imaging daily

## Recipes

* **Field capacity** = 200% GWC \(200 g water/100 g soil\), based upon extensive GWC testing done by Skyler Mitchell
* **Target weight** \(fc\) = \[\(water weight at % fc\) + \[\(average weight of carrier/saucer\) + \(dry soil weight\) + \(pot weight\)\]
* **Water weight** at 100% fc = dry soil weight \* \(%GWC/100\)
* **Water weight** at 30% fc = water weight at 100% fc \* 0.30
