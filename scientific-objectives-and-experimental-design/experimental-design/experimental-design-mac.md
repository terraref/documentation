## Season 1 soghum \(April - July 2016\)

[Three hundred thirty one lines were planted in Season 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=796817704).

#### Planting Design

**Under scanner system**

| **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BAP | 3 | 30 lines \(12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain\) | RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Night illumination | 3 | 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines \(with check line separating illumination levels\) | RCB |
| Row \# | 3 | 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) x 2 sides \(east or west\) | RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
| Biomass | 3 | 5 sampling times x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Density | 3 | 3 densities \(5, 15, 30 cm\) x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB |
| RILs | 3 | 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep | Incomplete Block \(row-column alpha lattice design\) |
| Uniformity | 17 | 2 lines \(forage, PS\) | None - Same line planted in single range |

**West of scanner system**

| **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BAP | 1 | 30 lines \(12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain\) | None - single rep planted for observation |
| RILs | 3 | 60 RILs | Incomplete Block \(row-column alpha lattice design\) |

### Automated Phenotpying

The [Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field Gantry System](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) is the largest field crop analytics robot in the world. This high-throughput phenotyping field-scanning robot has a 30-ton steel gantry that autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails while continuously imaging the crops growing below it with a diverse array of [cameras and sensors](http://terraref.org/articles/lemnatec-scanalyzer-field-sensors/).

Twelve sensors are attached to the gantry system. Detailed information for each sensor including name, variable measured, and field of view are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=1886254108&single=true&widget=true&headers=false). The planned sensor missions and their objectives for 2016 are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=2092320800&single=true&widget=true&headers=false).
