## Field phenotyping
####Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona

Over 300 sorghum accessions and recombinant inbred lines were planted at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center and USDA Arid Land Research Station in Maricopa, Arizona. Field Scanner

- The [*Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field System*](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) is the largest field crop analytics robot in the world. This high-throughput phenotyping field-scanning robot has a 30-ton steel gantry that autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails while continuously imaging the crops growing below it with a diverse array of [*cameras and sensors*](http://terraref.org/articles/lemnatec-scanalyzer-field-sensors/).
- The **PhenoTractor** is fitted with a sensor frame that supports a real time kinematic (RTK) satellite navigation antenna, a sonar transducer,  an infrared temperature (IRT) scanner, and three [GreenSeeker crop sensing systems](http://www.trimble.com/agriculture/greenseeker.aspx).
- UAV (release V1)
- Manually Collected Field Data - Data will be collected manually to verify the sensor-collected data.

## Controlled-environment phenotyping
####Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Missouri

The Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility is a climate controlled 70 m<sup>2</sup> growth house with a conveyor belt system for moving plants to and from fluorescence, color, and near infrared imaging cabinets. This automated, high-throughput platform allows repeated non-destructive time-series image capture and multi-parametric analysis of 1,140 plants in a single experiment.
