#Development

TERRA members may submit data to Clowder, BETYdb, and CoGe.  

- **Clowder** contains data related to the field scanner operations and sensor box, including bounding box of each image / dataset as well as location of the sensor, data types and processing level, scanner missions.

- **BETYdb** contains plot locations and other geolocations of interest (e.g. fields, rows, plants) that are associated with agronomic experimental design / meta-data (what was planted where, field boundaries, treatments, etc).

- **CoGe** contains genomic data.

They may also develop **extractors** - services that run silently alongside Clowder.
