# Environmental conditions

Environment conditions data is collected using the Vaisala CO2, Thies Clima weather sensors as well as lightning, irrigation, and weather data collected at the Maricopa site.

Data formats follow the [Climate and Forecast \(CF\) conventions](http://cfconventions.org/) for variable names and units. Environmental data are stored in the Geostreams database.

## Data sources

* WeatherStation coordinates are 33.074457 N, 111.975163 W
* EnvironmentLogger is on top of the gantry system and is moveable.
* Irrigation is managed at the field level. There are four regions that can be irrigated at different rates. 

## Data access

### Level 1 data

Level 1 meteorological data is aggregated to from 1 Hz raw data to 5 minute averages or sums.

#### netCDF: 5s \(12 per minute\) observations

On Globus or Workbench you can find these data provided in both hourly and daily files. These files contain data at the original temporal resolution of 1/s. In addition, they contain the high resolution spectral radiometer data.

`sites/ua-mac/Level_1/envlog_netcdf`

* hourly files: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_environmentallogger.nc`
* daily files: `envlog_netcdf_L1_ua-mac_YYYY-MM-DD.nc`

#### Geostreams: 5 minute observations

Data can be accessed using the geostreams API or the PEcAn meteorological workflow. These are illustrated in the [sensor data tutorials](https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/blob/master/sensors/01-meteorological-data.Rmd).

Here is the json representation of a single five-minute observation:

### Raw Data

Data is available via Globus or Workbench:

* `/ua-mac/raw_data/co2sensor`
* `/ua-mac/raw_data/EnvironmentLogger`
* `/ua-mac/raw_data/irrigation`
* `/ua-mac/raw_data/lightning`
* `/ua-mac/raw_data/weather`

## Sensor information:

* [Thies Clima Sensor collection ](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/datasets/5873a9724f0cad7d8131b4d3)

## Computational pipeline

[**Environmental Logger**](https://github.com/terraref/extractors-environmental)

* **Description:** EnvironmentalLogger raw files are converted to netCDF.

## Known Issues

Known issue: the irrigation data stream does not currently handle variable irrigation rates within the field. Specifically, we have not yet accounted for the Summer 2017 drought experiments. See [terraref/reference-data\#196](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/196) for more information.

When the full field is irrigated \(as is typical\), the irrigated area is 5466.1 m2 \(=215.2 m x 25.4 m\)

In 2017:

* Full field irrigated area from the start of the season to August 1 \(103 dap\) is 5466.1 m2 \(=215.2 m x 25.4 m\).
* Well-watered treatment zones from August 1 to 15 \(103 to 116 dap\): 2513.5 m2 \(=215.2 m x 11.68 m\) in total, combined areas of non-contiguous blocks
* Well-watered treatment zones from August 15 - 30 \(116 to 131 dap\): 3169.9 m2 \(=215.2 m x 14.73 m\), again in total as the combined areas of non-contiguous blocks
