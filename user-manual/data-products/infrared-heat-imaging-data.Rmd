# Infrared heat imaging data

## Summary

Infrared heat imaging data is collected collected using the FLIR SC615 thermal sensor. These data are provided as geotiff image raster files as well as plot level means.

* Algorithms are in the [flir2tif directory of the Multispectral extractor](https://github.com/terraref/extractors-multispectral/tree/master/flir2tif) repository; see the readme for details. 
* Sensor information: [FLIR Thermal Camera collection](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/datasets/5873a7184f0cad7d8131994a)

## Level 1 Data Access

### Filesystem \(Globus and Workbench\)

* `ua-mac/Level_1/ir_geotiff`

### Clowder

To be created [https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/391](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/issues/391)

## Level 3 Data

Plot level summaries are named ['surface\_temperature'](http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/surface_temperature) in the trait database. In the future this name will be used for the Level 1 data as well. This name from the Climate Forecast \(CF\) conventions, and is used instead of 'canopy\_temperature' for two reasons: First, because we do not \(currently\) filter soil in this pipeline. Second, because the CF definition of surface\_temperature distinguishes the surface from the medium: "The surface temperature is the temperature at the interface, not the bulk temperature of the medium above or below."

## Raw data access

Thermal imaging data is available via Clowder and Globus:

`/ua-mac/raw_data/flirIrCamera`

For details about using this data via Clowder or Globus, please see [Data Access](https://github.com/terraref/documentation/tree/56f669dc870b3c3921bfc029914545574e70f8df/how-to-access-data.md) section.

## Known Issues

* Data are unavailable for Season 4 \(summer 2017 sorghum\) and season 5 \(winter 2017-2018 wheat\).
  * Work to recover these data is ongoing; see [terraref/reference-data\#190](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/190)
  * Problem description [terraref/reference-data\#182](https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues/182)
