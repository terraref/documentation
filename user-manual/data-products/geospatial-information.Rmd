# Geospatial information

Several different sensors include geospatial information in the dataset metadata describing the location of the sensor at the time of capture.

**Coordinate reference systems**  
The Scanalyzer system itself does not have a reliable GPS unit on the sensor box. There are 3 different coordinate systems that occur in the data:

* Most common is EPSG:4326 \(WGS84\) USDA coordinates
* Tractor planting & sensor data is in UTM Zone 12
* Sensor position information is captured relative to the southeast corner of the Scanalyzer system in meters

EPSG:4326 coordinates for the four corners of the Scanalyzer system \(bound by the rails above\) are as follows:

* **NW**: 33° 04.592' N, -111° 58.505' W
* **NE**: 33° 04.591' N, -111° 58.487' W
* **SW**: 33° 04.474' N, -111° 58.505' W
* **SE**: 33° 04.470' N, -111° 58.485' W

In the trait database, this site is named the ["MAC Field Scanner Field"](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/sites/6000000001) and its bounding polygon is ["POLYGON \(\(-111.9747967 33.0764953 358.682, -111.9747966 33.0745228 358.675, -111.9750963 33.074485715 358.62, -111.9750964 33.0764584 358.638, -111.9747967 33.0764953 358.682\)\)"](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/v1/sites?key=9999999999999999999999999999999999999999&id=6000000001)

**Scanalyzer coordinates**  
Finally, the Scanalyzer coordinate system is right-handed - the origin is in the SE corner, X increases going from south to north, and Y increases from east to the west.

In offset meter measurements from the southeast corner of the Scanalyzer system, the extent of possible motion for the sensor box is defined as:

* **NW**: \(207.3, 22.135, 5.5\)
* **SE**: \(3.8,    0, 0\)  

_Scanalyzer -&gt; EPSG:4326_  
1. Calculate the UTM position of known SE corner point 2. Calculate the UTM position of the target point, using SE point as reference 3. Get EPSG:4326 position based on UTM

**MAC coordinates**  
Tractor planting data and tractor sensor data will use UTM Zone 12.

_Scanalyzer -&gt; MAC_  
Given a Scanalyzer\(x,y\), the MAC\(x,y\) in UTM zone 12 is calculated using the linear transformation formula:

```text
ay = 3659974.971; by = 1.0002; cy = 0.0078;
ax = 409012.2032; bx = 0.009; cx = - 0.9986;
Mx = ax + bx * Gx + cx * Gy
My = ay + by * Gx + cy * Gy
```

Assume `Gx = -Gx'`, where `Gx'` is the Scanalyzer X coordinate.

_MAC -&gt; Scanalyzer_

```text
Gx = ( (My/cy - ay/cy) - (Mx/cx - ax/cx) ) / (by/cy - bx/cx)
Gy = ( (My/by - ay/by) - (Mx/bx - ax/bx) ) / (cy/by - cx/bx)
```

_MAC -&gt; EPSG:4326 USDA_  
We do a linear shifting to convert MAC coordinates in to EPSG:4326 USDA

```text
Latitude: Uy = My - 0.000015258894
Longitude: Ux = Mx + 0.000020308287
```

**field scanner plots**

There are 864 \(54\*16\) plots in total and the plot layout is described in the [plot plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo) table.

| dimension | value |
| :--- | :--- |
| \# rows | 32 |
| \# rows / plot | 2 |
| \# plots \(2 rows ea\) | 864 |
| \# ranges | 54 |
| \# columns | 16 |
| row width \(m\) | 0.762 |
| plot length \(m\) | 4 |
| row length \(m\) | 3.5 |
| alley length \(m\) | 0.5 |

The boundary of each plot changes slightly each planting season. The scanalyzer coordinates of each row and each range of the two planting seasons is available in the [field book](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eQSeVMPfrWS9Li4XlJf3qs2F8txmddbwZhjOfMGAvt8/edit#gid=883764630). The scanalyzer coordinates of each plot are transformed into the \(EPSG:4326\) USDA coordinates using the equations above. After that, a polygon of each plot can be generated using ST\_GeomFromText funtion and inserted into the BETYdb through SQL statements.

An [Rcode](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/blob/master/scripts/geospatial/field_scanner_plots.R) is available for generating SQL statements based on the scanalyzer coordinates of each plot, which takes range.csv and row.csv as standard inputs.

The range.csv should be in the following format:

| range | x\_south | x\_north |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ... | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... |
| 3 | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |

And the row.csv should look like:

| row | y\_west | y\_east |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ... | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... |
| 3 | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |

The output will be something look like:

```text
INSERT INTO sites (sitename, geometry) VALUES ( 'MAC Field Scanner Field Plot 1 Season 2',
ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-111.975049874375 33.0745312921391 353, -111.975033517034 33.0745313124814 353,

```
