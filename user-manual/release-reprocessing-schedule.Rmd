# Release / reprocessing schedule

We will release the data in stages or tiers.

## First Tier

The first tier will be an internal release to the TERRA-REF team and the standards committee. This first tier release will be to initially quality check and calibrate the data and will take place as data sets are produced and compiled.

* By November 2016, it is an objective of the TERRA-REF team to establish a data release pipeline, wherein the release of data to this first tier will be within 21 days from the date of collection.
* Access to the data will be arranged for by the resource producer \(i.e. limiting access to selected users\).

## Second Tier

The second tier will enable the release of the data generated solely by the TERRA-REF team to other TERRA teams as well as non-TERRA entities.

* By November 2017, it is an objective of the TERRA-REF team to establish a data release pipeline, wherein the release of data to this second tier will be within 10 days from the data of collection.
* It is noted that release of the data to the second tier may occur prior to publication and that access is granted with the understanding that the contributions and interests of the TERRA-REF team should be recognized and respected by the users of the data. The TERRA-REF team reserves the right to analyze and published its own data, provided that this is done in a timely fashion. Resource users should appropriately cite the source of the data and acknowledge the resource produces. The publication the data, as suggested in the TERRA-REF Authorship Guidelines, should specify the collaborative nature of the project, and authorship is expected to include all those contributing significantly to the work.
* Access to the data will be determined by the resource producers and may be governed by separate license or other agreements.
* It is an objective of the TERRA-REF team to enable the release of the data to the public by November 2018 but no later than the date of close-out of the awarded funds.
