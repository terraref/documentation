# Data Product Creation

## Data Product Levels

Data products are processed at various levels ranging from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 products are raw data at full instrument resolution. At higher levels, the data are converted into more useful parameters and formats. These are derived from NASA and NEON

| Level | Description |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Reconstructed, unprocessed, full resolution instrument data; artifacts and duplicates removed. |  |
| 1a | Level 0 plus time-referenced and annotated with calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters \(level 0 is fully recoverable from level 1a data\). |  |
| 1b | Level 1a processed to sensor units \(level 0 not recoverable\) |  |
| 2 | Derived variables \(e. g., NDVI, height, fluorescence\) at the level 1 resolution. |  |
| 3 | Level 2 mapped to uniform grid, missing points gap filled; overlapping images combined |  |
| 4 | 'phenotypes' derived variables associated with a particular plant or genotype rather than a spatial location |  |
