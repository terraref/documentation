# Agronomic and Phenotype Data Standards

## Current Practice

In TERRA-REF v0 release, agronomic and phenotype data is stored and exchanged using the [BETYdb API](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/docs). Agronomic data is stored in the `sites`, `managements`, and `treatments` tables. Phenotype data is stored in the `traits`, `variables`, and `methods` tables. Data is ingested and accessed via the BETYdb API formats.

## Standardization Efforts

In cooperation with participants from [AgMIP](http://research.agmip.org/display/research/Welcome+to+AgMIP+Research), the [Crop Ontology](http://www.cropontology.org/), and [Agronomy Ontology ](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/agro)groups, the TERRA-REF team is pursuing the development of a format to facilitate the exchange of data across systems based on the ICASA Vocabulary and AgMIP JSON Data Objects. An initial draft of this format is available for comment on [Github.](https://github.com/craig-willis/icasa)

In addition, we plan to enable the TERRA-REF databases to import and export data via the [Plant Breeding API \(BRAPI\)](https://github.com/terraref/documentation/tree/56f669dc870b3c3921bfc029914545574e70f8df/docs.brapi.apiary.io).
