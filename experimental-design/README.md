# Experimental Design

## Overview

### Phenotyping

The TERRA-REF project is collecting phenotype data from 852 ****sorghum genotypes grown in three locations:

* [Maricopa Agricultural Center \(MAC\), Maricopa, Arizona](experimental-design-mac.md)
* Kansas State University \(KSU\), Ashland, KS
* [Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Missouri](experimental-design-danforth.md)

| Data source | MAC | KSU | Danforth |

| Scanalyzer Field System | X |  |  |
| [Scanalyzer 3D System](../protocols/controlled-environment-protocols.md) |  |  | X |

| [UAV \(drone\)](../protocols/uav-protocols.md) | X | X |  |
| [Manual field data](../protocols/manual-field-data-protocols.md) | X | X |  |

### Genotyping

[Whole genome resequencing](experimental-design/experimental-design-genomics/) is being carried out on ~[400 sorghum accessions](experimental-design/experimental-design-genomics/sorghum-lines-genomics-year-1.md) to understand the landscape of genetic variation in the selected germplasm and enable high-resolution mapping of bioenergy traits with genome wide association studies \(GWAS\). Additionally, ~200 sorghum recombinant inbred lines \(RILs\) will be characterized with ~400,000 genetic markers using genotyping-by-sequencing \([Morris et al., 2013](http://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2013/09/13/g3.113.008417)\) for trait dissection in the RIL population and testcross hybrids of the RIL population.
