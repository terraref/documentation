## Season 1 sorghum \(April - July 2016\)

[Three hundred thirty one lines were planted in Season 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=796817704).

#### Planting Design

**Under scanner system**

| **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BAP | 3 | 30 lines \(12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain\) | RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Night illumination | 3 | 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines \(with check line separating illumination levels\) | RCB |
| Row \# | 3 | 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) x 2 sides \(east or west\) | RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
| Biomass | 3 | 5 sampling times x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Density | 3 | 3 densities \(5, 15, 30 cm\) x 3 lines \(forage, sweet, PS\) | RCB |
| RILs | 3 | 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep | Incomplete Block \(row-column alpha lattice design\) |
| Uniformity | 17 | 2 lines \(forage, PS\) | None - Same line planted in single range |
