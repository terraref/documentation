### Abstract

### Materials

#### Platforms

* SenseFly eBee fixed-wing drone
* Hexacopter

#### Cameras

UAV data are collected using one of three cameras: 

* 5-band [MicaSense RedEdge](https://www.micasense.com/rededge)
* 4-band + RGB [Parrot Sequoia](https://www.micasense.com/sequoia)
* SenseFly thermal [thermoMap](https://www.sensefly.com/drones/accessories.html)

Cameras are carried singly or in tandem on the SenseFly eBee fixed-wing drone (Sequoia and thermoMap, individually only), or a hexacopter (RedEdge or Sequoia, individually or in tandem).

### Procedure

#### Flight 

Standard flight altitude is 44m with 75% image overlap (both sequentially and laterally), and missions are programmed and managed by either [Mission Planner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/index.html#) or senseFly [eMotion](https://www.sensefly.com/software/emotion-2.html).

#### Calibration

No radiometric calibration was conducted as of Nov 5, 2016.

#### Analysis

Pix4D software was used to generate gray-scale orthomosaic geotiff files containing NDVI data after georegistration to the WGS84/UTM 12 N coordinate reference system using 3-5 2D geo-located ground control points manually matched to 5-40 images each. Ground control points were georegistered using a RTK base station maintained by the USDA-ARS at Maricopa.

QGIS software was used to confirm geospatial alignment of NDVI geotiffs with shape files containing geolocated positions of the rail foundations. A shape file containing polygons aligning with the middle two rows of each of the 350 experimental units (for sorghum crop Aug-Nov 2016) was kindly generated by Dr. A French of USDA-ARS. Zonal Statistics in QGIS was used to calculate NDVI means for each plot polygon.
