# Developer Manual

TERRA members may submit data to Clowder, BETYdb, and CoGe.

* **Clowder** contains data related to the field scanner operations and sensor box, including bounding box of each image / dataset as well as location of the sensor, data types and processing level, scanner missions.
* **BETYdb** contains plot locations and other geolocations of interest \(e.g. fields, rows, plants\) that are associated with agronomic experimental design / meta-data \(what was planted where, field boundaries, treatments, etc\).
* **CoGe** contains genomic data.

They may also develop **extractors** - services that run silently alongside Clowder.
